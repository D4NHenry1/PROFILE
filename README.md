Helllllllo!!
Name's Henry, i'm 18yo and i'm a beginner Rust developer, discovering every day what this awesome language hides.
I'm trying to build my own portfolio for the first time, so i don't expect it to be incredible haha.
I'm a student at UniSenai PR - Londrina, PR, Brazil, and i'm at the Software Engineering course, trying to learn more every day.
